                  <b>Did you know that</b> Ghanaian names (or Personal names in Ghana)
                  consists of several given names and surnames based on the language of
                  ethnic groups in Ghana including Akan. Frequently, children are given a
                  "day name" which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
                  These day names have further meanings concerning the soul and character
                  of the person. Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer
                  to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name. These
                  names are also used among Ghanaians living abroad and among Africans
                  living in the diaspora who wish to identify with their ancestral
                  homeland. During the 18th-19th Century, the enslaved people from modern
                  day Ghana in the Caribbean were referred to as Coromantees. Most day
                  names among the Mole-Dagombas are usually given to the females and few
                  are given to both sexes. <br />
